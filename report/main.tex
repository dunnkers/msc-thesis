\section{Introduction}
% why evaluate feature rankers

% what we do in this paper: chapter setup.

\section{Related work}
% other papers that; talked about evaluating feature selection

% papers that take each metric separately; stability, etc.

% THEORY
% \section{Feature ranking}
    
\section{Motivations for feature ranking}
% motivation for ranking and weighting features:
    % (1) feature selection
    % (2) interpretable AI
    \subsection{Feature selection}
    % so many dimensions...
    % not to be confused with: dimensionality reduction (PCA / t-SNE)
    \subsection{Interpretable AI}

\section{Methods for feature ranking}
    \subsection{Embedded}
    % early methods:
        % - ridge regression
        % - LASSO
    % (regularization methods)
